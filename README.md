🎓 **Background:**

* B.Eng. in Information Technology (AI Specialization) from **Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology and Education (HCMUTE)**.
* Research Assistant at the **Artificial Intelligence & Intelligent Systems Laboratory (AISLab)** under the supervision of Assoc. Prof. Dr. Van-Dung Hoang.
* Recipient of the **Best Thesis Award** and multiple **Scientific Research Awards** for outstanding academic and research achievements.

🧠 **Core Expertise:**

* **Computer Vision:** Image classification, segmentation (UNet, DeepLabv3+), object detection (Faster R-CNN, Mask R-CNN), action recognition (skeleton-based).
* **Natural Language Processing:** Machine Translation, Conversational AI, Log Analysis with Transformers/BERT.
* **Deep Learning Frameworks:** PyTorch, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas.
* **Programming:** Python (main), Golang (entry-level), SQL, Apache Hive.

📚 **Selected Research & Publications:**

* *Skeleton-based Multi-person Action Recognition towards Real-world Violence Detection* — *Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence (EAAI, Q1, IF 8.0)*
* *Automatic Recognition and Scoring System in Military Training Applies Modern Deep Learning Techniques* — *Springer GOODTECHS 2024*
* *Skeleton-Based Posture Estimation for Human Action Recognition Using Deep Learning* — *Springer GreenTech 2024*

🏆 **Highlights:**

* Led multiple **university-funded AI research projects**, from proposal to implementation and publication.
* Experience with **Medical Image Processing**, **Surveillance AI**, and **Vision-Language Models (VLMs)**.
* Awarded **Best Student Research Project 2024**, **Outstanding Student in Scientific Research**, and **Euréka Semifinalist (2023, 2024)**.

💼 **What I Offer on Upwork:**

* Custom Deep Learning model design, training, and optimization (CV or NLP).
* Image segmentation and classification pipelines for medical or industrial use.
* NLP solutions — translation, question answering, and chatbot systems.
* Research paper implementation and reproducibility services.
