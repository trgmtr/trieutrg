<img class="profile-picture" src="favicon.jpg">

Hi! My name is Truong Minh Trieu. I was born in 2003 in Dien Ban, Quang Nam Province (now Dien Ban Tay Commune, Da Nang City). 

Currently, I am a Master's and Ph.D Integrated student in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) in the [Department of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence (Dept. CSAI)](https://cse.dongguk.edu/main) at [Dongguk University](http://www.dongguk.ac.kr/), Seoul, South Korea. I am also a Research Assistant at the [Computational Imaging Lab. (CILab)](https://cilab.dongguk.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof. Chul Lee](https://cilab.dongguk.edu/cv.html).

Before that, I graduated from HCMC University of Technology and Education and worked as a Data Scientist at FPT Telecom Hanoi.
